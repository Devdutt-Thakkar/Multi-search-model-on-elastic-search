To run this use python 3.10 and install any library required by installing libraries mentioned in requirements.txt, then any extra libraries to be downloaded will be downloaded during the program run if there are any left, then change the api key and url from your elastic cloud project and then run this app.py file and the program will start executing. Here I have implemented multi-search in elastic-cloud and you can enter any type of query whether sql or natural language and the results might not be that accurate due to fuzzy search functionality turned on that can mistake a users input sometimes to a value which is similar to the input as well hence rather than fetching results which could have been very accurate as per the accurate search, the results might not be that accurate.
